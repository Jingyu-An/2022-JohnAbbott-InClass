# 18. Darnell sometimes needs to contact the warehouse managers, accountants, administrative assistants,
#     and other employees at the warehouse where they work.
#     Create a contact list that he can use to phone employees,
#         and that contains enough information to identity employees, their positions,
#         and their warehouses along with the warehouse phone number.
#         Because Darnell might eventually use this list as the basis for a report,
#             the employeeâ€™s name should appear as one full name, with the last name first.
#             When you show this query to Darnell, he realizes that it would be more helpful
#                 if he could specify a particular warehouse before producing the list,
#                 and then see the contact information only for the employees who work in that warehouse.
#         Create a script that meets these needs,
#     saving it as 11_EmployeeContactByWarehouse.

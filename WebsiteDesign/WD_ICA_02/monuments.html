                This monument, located in Colorado and Utah, was designated as a national
                monument in 1915. It was discovered by paleontologist Earl Douglass on August
                17, 1909. The 200,000 acre area was layered with prehistoric plant and animal
                fossils and contained 350 tons of fossils, including full skeletons and remains of
                some dinosaur species that previously were unknown.

                The Colorado National Monument, located in Fruita, Colorado, covers about 20,000
                acres. The sheer walls and deep canyons are considered one of the grand landscapes
                of the American West.

                Volcanic eruptions formed fossil beds when they sent lava and mud into the
                Florissant Basin millions of years ago. The monument is known for more than
                80,000 identified animal and plant specimens and is located just west of Pikes Peak.

                Colorado offers unequaled
                natural mountain scenery,
                abundant wildlife, and more
                outdoor activities than you can
                imagine. The name Colorado
                comes from the Spanish word
                “colorado” which means
                “reddish color.” On August 1,
                1876, President Ulysses Grant
                proclaimed Colorado the 38th
                state. <br>

            <p>
                Colorado’s spectacular scenery
                extends from the Rocky
                Mountains National Park to the
                Florissant Fossil Beds National
                Monument. Visitors flock to
                Colorado to enjoy the state’s
                four national parks, five national
                monuments, and over forty state
                parks. <br>
